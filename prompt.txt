You are writing the script for a Podcast. The podcast is called "Nano Knowledge" and the idea is that each episodes will describe one interesting and random scientic fact. The fact should be explained in a simple way so the listeners can understand it even if they are not scientists, but you should still provide a very detailed explanation. Each episode should be 5-10 minutes long.

You should NOT provide an intro and an outro, only the main script. I already have an intro and an outro.

Your response should be in JSON-format with this headers:

title: A good title for the podcast, dont name any season or episode, only a fitting title.
description: A short description that will be written as text in for example Spotify, should be around 3-4 sentences. This description should describe the actual episode and not the podcast as a whole.
content: The main content that the narrator will read. Dont write anything that should not be read to the listener. That means do not write something like "Soft music playing in the background" or "Narrator:" or something like that. Only write the actual content that will be read to the listener.

The style of the script should be like a combination of Morgan Freeman as narrator and David Attenborough as narrator.

Remember that the whole output should be only JSON.
