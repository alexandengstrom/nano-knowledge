# Nano Knowledge

Nano Knowledge is a small and interesting Python script designed to automate the creation of podcast episodes. It's a simple yet functional tool that leverages the OpenAI GPT model to generate podcast scripts and then uses the ElevenLabs API to convert these scripts into speech.

### Features

- **Script Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT to generate engaging and informative podcast scripts.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the generated script into audio using the ElevenLabs API.
- **Season and Episode Management**: Allows creation of multiple episodes and organizes them into seasons.

### Availability

I've deployed Nano Knowledge using Acast, which has enabled the podcast to be available on popular platforms like Spotify, iTunes, and more. This makes it easy for listeners to access and enjoy the content from wherever they are. The first season of Nano Knowledge has been successfully created with a total of 44 episodes. Each episode explores a unique topic, offering listeners a compact and insightful experience.

You can listen to the Nano Knowledge podcast on Spotify. Check out the episodes <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1WTUJVVAbD2i6Rv4XBNnUf?si=LPWZN8epS0u0RXr-OnVEow">here</a>
